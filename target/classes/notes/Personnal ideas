1. Player can move in diagonals
    I added four directions in Player.java : "rightUp", "leftUp", "rightDown", "leftDown".
    This direction are set when the two required keys are pressed.
    As I only have right and left sprites at the moment, I added the String orientation to determine if the player is looking left or right.

    Collision were more complex to handle as I wanted the player to slide against wall if he moved in diagonal in that direction.
    To do so diagonals collision are checked differently. I added booleans to Entity.java : upOk, downOk, rightOk, downOk.
    CollisionChecker sets those booleans to false if a collision occure.
    Then those booleans are checked in the Player class. If both are true, the player moves in diagonal, if only one is true,
    the Player moves in that direction.

2. NPC have a restricted zone to move in

3. Add a dash to the player

4. Give the player a gun

4. Dialogue size
    Check dialogue size and if it is too big for the rectangle, you start from the last index and search the first space before
    the max length and make an new line
