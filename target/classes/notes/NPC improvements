    1: UtilityTool resizing works for object but not NPC (Need to modify the draw methods?)
        It was indeed the the drawImage in Entity that had arguments for resizing when called.

2: All entity should have 8 directions and 2x8 images
This might require changes in CollisionChecker or at least more cases

3: All entity should have a height and width that are used for image resizing and solidArea size
